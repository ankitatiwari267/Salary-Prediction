 # Dataset
 Dataset consist of the salary of 30 emplyoyees based on their years of experience.
 1. Training data - 2/3 of the dataset (20 entries)
 2. Testing data - 1/3 of the dataset (10 entries)
 # Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
